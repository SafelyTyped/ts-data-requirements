# Welcome To @safelytyped/data-requirements!

## Introduction

Data Requirements is a Typescript library. Use it to build type validators for anonymous objects in your libraries.

At the moment, this is very much an experimental library. I'm expecting it to change a lot before the v1.0 release.

## Quick Start

```
# run this from your Terminal
npm install @safelytyped/data-requirements
```

## Documentation
